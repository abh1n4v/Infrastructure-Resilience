sentimental analysis

Sentiment analysis is a technique used to identify the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. In the context of your research project on the Kerala floods of 2018, 
you could use sentiment analysis on the tweets you have sourced to identify the sentiment expressed in tweets related to infrastructure resilience and community resilience. 

Preprocess the data: You'll first need to preprocess the tweets by removing any URLs, hashtags, and mentions, as these may not be relevant for sentiment analysis. 
You may also need to perform other preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal to prepare the data for analysis.

Choose a sentiment analysis tool: There are many sentiment analysis tools available that can analyze the sentiment of text data. You can use tools such as VADER, TextBlob,
or IBM Watson to perform sentiment analysis on your tweets.

Analyze the sentiment: Once you have preprocessed the data and chosen a sentiment analysis tool, you can analyze the sentiment of each tweet. The tool will assign a positive, 
negative, or neutral sentiment score to each tweet based on the words and phrases used in the tweet.

Identify commonly discussed topics and themes: After you have analyzed the sentiment of the tweets, you can identify the most commonly discussed topics and themes by performing 
topic modeling on the data. Topic modeling is a technique used to identify the topics or themes that are discussed in a collection of text data. You can use tools such as Latent 
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to perform topic modeling on your tweets.

Visualize the results: Once you have analyzed the sentiment and identified the commonly discussed topics and themes, you can visualize the results using charts, graphs, and other 
visualization techniques. This will help you to better understand the sentiment and topics discussed in the tweets related to infrastructure resilience and community resilience 
during and after the Kerala floods of 2018.

Overall, sentiment analysis and topic modeling can be useful techniques for identifying sentiment and commonly discussed topics and themes in a collection of text data 
such as tweets. By using these techniques, you can gain insights into the sentiment and topics discussed on Twitter during and after the Kerala floods of 2018, which can 
help you to better understand the impact of the disaster on infrastructure and community resilience.



1. preprocessing
  -> Convert all text to lowercase
  -> Remove all punctuation and emojis
  -> Remove words such as "and" "the" "a" etc as stopwords
  -> Lemmatization: removes the grammar tense and transforms each word into its original form.

2. analysis
    based on the content in each row, we need to find what the main theme of the tweet is, ie, if the tweet is requesting for help, talking about the flood, about donations, 
    hopes and prayers, or something general
