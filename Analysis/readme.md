# EXPLORATORY CASE STUDY ON INFRASTRUCTURE RESILIENCE IN KERALA USING SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYSIS

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyse the impact of the Kerala 2018 Floods and its effects on community and infrastructure resilience, via the tweets posted on Twitter during the same.
By analyzing a dataset of tweets related to the floods, we aim to explore the sentiment of people towards the disaster and the response efforts, and to understand the factors that contributed to the resilience or vulnerability of the affected communities and infrastructure. Through this analysis, we hope to generate insights that can inform policy decisions and future disaster preparedness and response efforts, and to demonstrate the value of Twitter as a platform for real-time communication and public engagement during times of crisis.

## Abstract
This study presents a novel approach to analysing major disasters using Twitter data. The goal is to assess the potential of Twitter as a source of information for investigating disasters by exclusively analysing tweets posted by users during past events. This approach is applied to the major flood that occured in Kerala in 2018, utilising diverse analytical techniques to generate comprehensive graphical outputs. This provides insights into users' needs during a disaster as well as the timing and geographic distribution of tweets

This project demonstrates that analysing social media data provides a feasible, cost-effective, straightforward and immediate alternative to traditional methods for dsaster management, and enhances our understanding of the affected population's awareness and response to natural calamities.

The analysis of tweets also shed light on the infrastructure and community resilience of the affected regions. By examining the language used in the tweets and the frequency of certain keywords, it is possible to identify the areas where infrastructure was particularly vulnerable and the extent to which community members were able to respond to the disaster. This information can help to inform future disaster response efforts and improve community resilience.
